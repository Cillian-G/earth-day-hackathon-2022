Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. We utilised Chrome developer tools whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as we went along.

During development we made use of google developer tools to ensure everything was working correctly and to assist with troubleshooting when things were not working as expected.

We utilised the console in the developer tools to work through small sections of JavaScript and ensure that the code was working, and also to troubleshoot where issues were.

We have gone through each page using google chrome developer tools to ensure that each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices.
